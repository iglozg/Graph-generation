# Graph-generation
Graph generation code made during Introduction to programming class at SDU for Master course in Computational Biomedicine.
Repository consists of 3 files:
-visualiser_rndgraph.py: file provided by the lecturer which was used as a help in this project and it's part of the code
-graph_sim.py: file that generates and outputs the graph simulation
-Interface.py: main file which is the starting file for the code, it acts as an interactive interface for the user.
This project was done as a part 1 of the project made during the class Introduction to programming. There might be some bugs in the code. This project was mostly done by myself.
